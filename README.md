# Chinese-IPTV

Chinese CCTV List (IPV6)

New features:
1. Complete TV stations list. (Thanks kunKun-tx, https://github.com/kunKun-tx/Chinese-IPTV)
2. Added EPG (Electronic Program Guide) support. (CCTVs are accurate, and Local TVs are not detailed. Thanks
WebGrab+Plus, http://webgrabplus.com/)

   guide.xml is EPG file.

If IPTV app supports remote path, such as PVR IPTV simple client in KODI, you could use both files here, playlist.m3u and
guide.xml. If your time zone is Eastern Time Zone (UTC-5), EPG time shift is -5
because time in guide.xml is UTC-0. Otherwise, you can change EPG time shift number
according to your time zone.
